<h2 class="top">Research</h2>

<p>
I am a theoretical physicist working in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>
where I use a combination of pen and paper theory and computer simulation to study coarse-grained models
of self-assembly, nucleation, and phase transformation. Working at the <a href="http://foundry.lbl.gov/">Molecular Foundry</a>,
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, I collaborate with experimentalists
and theorists to tackle problems with application to renewable energy and climate change. I also have a strong
interest in <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/">scientific computing</a>, algorithm development, and <a href="media/">data visualization</a>.

        <h3><a href="research/coarse-graining/">Coarse-grained models</a></h3>
        <p>Computational physics is hard and even relatively modest problems can quickly become intractable.
        Enter coarse-grained models, which help provide a simplified view of the physical world; capturing the
        fundamental details of a system, while ignoring all of the extraneous fluff that is unimportant to the
        question in hand.</p>

        <h3><a href="research/glass/">Supercooled liquids and glasses</a></h3>
        <p>It's a liquid... It's a solid... No, it's a glass. How can a material possess the mechanical
        properties of a solid yet have a molecular structure that is indistinguishable from a liquid?
        Find out why the glass transition remains one of the most interesting and elusive unsolved problems
        in the physics community. While there's little of interest in the structure, the dynamics are far
        from boring.

        <h3><a href="research/nucleation/">Nucleation</a></h3>
        <p>Nucleation is all around us and is one of the most important processes in the natural world:
        the creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor give rise to clouds, and ice forms from the
        freezing of water. While classical nucleation theory has been with us for around 100 years, recent
        improvements in computation and observation suggest that things are often far more complicated
        than this simple picture predicts.</p>
