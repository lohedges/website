<h2 class="top">LaTuXiT</h2>

<p>
If you've ever given a scientific presentation using OS X, chances are you've run across a very handy program
called <a href="http://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/">LaTeXiT</a>. This utility allows you to create nicely cropped
LaTeX typset equations that can be dragged and dropped into slides. A nice feature is the use of an equation library,
allowing the user to keep track of their LaTeXiT history, make modifications to existing equations, and share equations
between computers. Even neater is the LinkBack feature that allows image files that have been generated with LaTeXiT
to be re-opened for editing when they are dragged back into the application. That way you can drag an equation from a
Keynote slide into LaTeXiT, make some edits, then drag the new image back into the slide. This is really handy when you
make mistakes, or when dealing with lots of equations with slight variations.
</p>

<p>
There isn't anything quite so slick for Linux, at least anything that functions as a stand-alone package. There is
<a href="http://userbase.kde.org/KFormula">KFormula</a>, but this is now part of the Calligra suite (formerly KOffice).
Since I don't use KDE or Calligra, and don't want to pull a bunch of unwanted dependencies, I decided to write something
a little more lightweight.
</p>

<p>
My solution, <a href="https:github.com/lohedges/latuxit">LaTuXiT</a>, a simple Bash script that requires no
dependencies outside of the standard <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">Tex Live</a> core (other than
<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">Ghostscript</a> for additional PostScript support). The script replicates two
of LaTeXiT's key features: an equation library, and a link back feature to allow editing of existing equations.
LaTuXiT works by hashing each equation string and building a cache. Metadata written as comments in the output
PDF and PostScript images allows LaTuXiT to match an image to an equation in the cache. LaTuXiT has full RGB color
support and also accepts any of the 68 standard colors known to dvips. For more details on the workings of LaTuXiT,
please visit its <a href="https:github.com/lohedges/latuxit">GitHub</a> page.

<h2 class="top">Basic usage</h2>

<p>
Suppose we want a nice red image of the canonical partition function... here's a short example of a possible LaTuXiT workflow.
</p>

<samp>
$ latuxit -e "Z=\sum_s e^{\beta E_s}" -c "Red"
</samp>

<p>
There should now be two files in the working directory: latuxit.pdf, and latuxuit.ps. Let's open latuxit.pdf and see what it
looks like.
</p>

</div>
</center>

<p>
Whoops, it looks like we missed a minus sign, and how about we make the equation green instead.
The following command will extract equation metadata from <code>latuxit.pdf</code> and open the
equation in an editor where it can be corrected. Easy!
<p>

<samp>
$ latuxit latuxit.pdf -c "{102,255,0}"
</samp>

<p>
Let's check the modified image. Snazzy.

</div>

<h2 class="top">Searching the equation cache</h2>

<p>
Suppose you want to edit an equation but you've lost the image file. You can kind of remember the syntax, but it's
long and complicated so you don't really fancy attempting to type it out again. What do you do then?
</p>

<p>
Thankfully LaTuXiT offers a solution. As a starting point you could simply get LaTuXiT to list all of the equations
in the cache and use grep to look for matches.
</p>

<samp>
$ latuxit -l | grep "sin"<br>
abade05b27e49e91c5873deabb8f82f2 "\cos^2 x +\sin^2 x = 1"<br>
ee8ff71994abccb0897510910c944468 "\sin 2\theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta"
</samp>

<p>
Note that this is equivalent to running LaTuXiT in "search" mode, i.e.
</p>

<samp>
$ latuxit -s "sin"
</samp>

<p>
The two column output shows a list of matching hashes from the cache and the corresponding equations.
Say the first match is the equation that we want. To reprocess it we can simply run LaTuXiT in <code>hash</code> mode.
The hash string that is passed as a command-line argument should be long enough to ensure a unique match.
LaTuXiT will abort if multiple matches are found. The equation will be opened in an editor so that it can be modified
prior to processing.

<samp>
$ latuxit -m "abad"
</samp>
