<h2 class="top">Code</h2>

<p>
When not spending time writing scientific software and data analysis/visualization tools for my various <a href="research">research</a>
projects I also like to dabble in a few fun things on the side. Below are brief descriptions for a few small projects that I've made
available on my <a href="https:github.com/lohedges">GitHub</a> page. More detail can be found by following the links.</p>

		<h3><a href="code/latuxit/">LaTuXiT</a></h3>
		<p>A simple utility for producing pdf and postcript LaTeX typset equations for use in figures
		and presentations. LaTuXiT builds an equation cache and uses metadata, written as comments in
		the pdf and postscript files, to match against existing equations in the cache. This allows
		the user to make changes to an equation, such as correcting mistakes, or modifying the output color.</p>

<div class="ressect">
	<div class="resicon"><a href="code/rectify"><img src="http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w319/scratchmandoo/website/thumbs/rectify_small_zpsa2d4ffac.png" width="146" height="146" alt="[Icon]" /></a></div>
	<div class="restext">
		<h3><a href="code/rectify/">Rectify</a></h3>
		<p>Rectify uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to converge towards a target image by aplying a
		random sequence of rectangular black or white brush strokes to a canvas and blending them
		with the current pixels. Images produced by rectify have a somewhat ghostly, impressionistic
		quality.</p>

<div class="ressect">
	<div class="resicon"><a href="code/flux"><img src="http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w319/scratchmandoo/website/thumbs/flux_small_zpsc2a641c0.png" width="146" height="146" alt="[Icon]" /></a></div>
	<div class="restext">
		<h3><a href="code/flux/">Flux</a></h3>
		<p>Like rectify, flux also uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to converge towards a target
		image. This time the initial canvas is a randomization of the target and the algorithm
		evolves by attempting to swap, at random, pairs of nearest-neighbor pixels. Flux
		produces striking, high constrast images, whose pixels appear as if they are being
		manipulated by a magnetic field.
