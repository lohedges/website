<h2 class="top">Code</h2>

<p>
When not spending time writing scientific software and data analysis/visualization tools for my various <a href="research/">research</a>
projects I also like to dabble in a few fun things on the side. Below are brief descriptions for a few small projects that I've made
available on my <a href="https:github.com/lohedges">GitHub</a> page. More detail can be found by following the links.</p>

        <h3><a href="code/latuxit/">LaTuXiT</a></h3>
        <p>A simple utility for producing PDF and PostScript LaTeX typset equations for use in figures
        and presentations. LaTuXiT builds an equation library and uses metadata, written as comments in
        the PDF and PostScript files, to match against existing equations in the library. This allows
        the user to make changes to an equation, such as correcting mistakes, or modifying the output color.</p>

        <h3><a href="code/taskfarmer/">TaskFarmer</a></h3>
        <p> A simple task farmer for running serial tasks with mpirun. TaskFarmer enables many
        simulations to be run within a single mpirun allocation, hence ensuring 100% utilization of
        the cores for the duration of the wall time. This is useful for running many short tasks
        on a small number of cores, or to avoid resource wastage when individual tasks have
        markedly different run times.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://vmmc.xyz">LibVMMC</a></h3>
        <p>A fast and versatile C++ library to implement the "virtual-move" Monte Carlo
        (VMMC) algorithm: a method for approximating the dynamical evolution of systems
        of strongly interacting overdamped particles. The library is intended to make
        VMMC accessible to a wider audience, for whom the time required to code the
        algorithm poses a significant barrier to using the method.</p>

    <div class="restext">
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/lohedges/slsm">LibSLSM</a></h3>
        <p>A C++ implementation of a stochastic level-set method (SLSM).
        Unlike traditional level-set optimisation methods, which use a steepest
        descent approach, SLSM updates the level set using a stochastic differential
        equation. The addition of thermal noise enables the exploration of design
        space during the optimisation process. In situations where the objective
        function is non-convex, this allows for the possibility of escaping local
        minima and converging to the true global optimum. See the
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04681">paper</a> for further details.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/lohedges/aabbcc">AABB.cc</a></h3>
        <p>A C++ implementation of dynamic AABB trees for finding potential overlaps
        between objects of arbitrary shape and size. Based on code from the
        <a href=http://www.box2d.org>Box2d</a> physics engine, this library is
        tailored for use in molecular simulation, handling both periodic and non-periodic
        simulation boxes.</p>

        <h3><a href="code/rectify/">Rectify</a></h3>
        <p>Rectify uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to converge towards a target image by applying a
        random sequence of rectangular black or white brush strokes to a canvas and blending them
        with the current pixels. Images produced by rectify have a somewhat ghostly, impressionistic
        quality.</p>

    <div class="restext">
        <h3><a href="code/flux/">Flux</a></h3>
        <p>Like rectify, flux also uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to converge towards a target
        image. This time the initial canvas is a randomization of the target and the algorithm
        evolves by attempting to swap, at random, pairs of nearest-neighbor pixels. Flux
        produces striking, high constrast images, the pixels of which appear as if they are
        being manipulated by a magnetic field.
