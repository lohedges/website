<p>
While I'm not particularly artistic in my everyday life, I really enjoy making scientific visualizations,
artwork and animations. Part of the fun comes from the challenge of making something that is simultaneously
scientifically accurate, visually striking, and computer generated.

<p>
All of my images are produced from <i>real</i> simulation data and generated using a collection of custom command-line scripts.
Typically, the final images are rendered using <a href="http://www.povray.org">POV-Ray</a>. Movies/animations are encoded using
a combination of <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">MEncoder</a> and <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a>. Image manipulation
and scripting assistance are provided by the wonderful <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>.

        <h3><a href="media/cover-art/">Cover art</a></h3>
        <p>I have produced several pieces of artwork for the covers of scientific journals.
        A great image is a wonderful way of engaging people with your research. It's also an
        interesting challenge to try to find the single picture that best captures the story
        of a paper.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the many other images that I have produced. Several of these have
