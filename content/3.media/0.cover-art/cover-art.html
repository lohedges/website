<h2 class="top">Cover art</h2>

<p>
I have produced several pieces of artwork for the covers of scientific journals (both to promote my own research
publications, and for other people). Below are a selection of pieces along with short descriptions of each image.

		<p>I was invited to produce artwork for this special feature of PNAS on liquids and structural glasses.
		The image shows dynamic heterogeneity in a structural glass-forming liquid. Further details and an
		enlarged version of the image can be found at the following <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/36.cover-expansion">link</a>.
