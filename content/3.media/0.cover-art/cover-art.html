<h2 class="top">Cover art</h2>

<p>
I have produced several pieces of artwork for the covers of scientific journals (both to promote my own research
publications, and for other people). Below are a selection of pieces along with short descriptions of each image.

        <p>I helped <a href="http://nanotheory.lbl.gov/people/SteveWhitelam.html">Steve Whitelam</a> to make this image which
        was chosen for the inside cover of Soft Matter for our <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/sm/c4sm01021">
        publication</a> on the growth of equilibrium structures built from a large number of distinct component
        types. The image shows the growing front of an assembly. Each block interacts with only four unique neighbors
        giving it a specified position within the assembly. Our work suggests design rules for block interaction
        energetics that may help improve the fidelity of similar experimental structures that have recently been
        grown from DNA 'bricks'.

        Selective nucleation in porous media</a>. The image shows nucleation from an ensemble of pores of different
        size etched into a substrate. Due to geometric effects, nucleation is fastest from pores of a specific
        size. Nucleation is markedly slower when the size is much larger or smaller than this sweet spot.
        Our paper confirms the predicted scaling of the optimum pore size as a function of supersaturation.

        <p>In collaboration with <a href="http://annaschneider.org">Anna Schneider</a> I helped make this cover for
        <a href="http://www.cell.com/biophysj/">Biophysical Journal</a>. The image shows the structural
        arrangement of proteins in a statistical-mechanical model of a grana stack, which is part of the photosynthetic
        light-harvesting system. Check out the Biophysical Society's <a href="http://biophysicalsociety.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/new-bj-cover-doesnt-sacrifice-science-for-aesthetics/">blog</a>

        <p>I was invited to produce artwork for this special feature of <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">PNAS</a>
