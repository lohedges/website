<h2 class="top">Introduction</h2>
<p>
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar working at the <a href="http://foundry.lbl.gov/">Molecular Foundry</a>,
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. My expertise is in the field of
statistical mechanics where I use a combination of pen and paper theory and computer simulation to study <a href="research/coarse-graining/">coarse-grained</a>
models of self-assembly, nucleation, and phase transformation.

As part of the <a href="http://esd.lbl.gov/research/facilities/ncgc/">Center for Nanoscale Control of Geologic CO<sub>2</sub></a>
I have been studying simple model systems that mimic some of the key features of carbonate crystallization.
This includes nucleation via amorphous intermediates and the emergence of competing ordered phases. The models have been
used to investigate the early stages of carbonate <a href="research/nucleation/">nucleation</a> in bulk solution and the
effect of confinement on nucleation rates in porous materials. I have also attempted to address some of the shortcomings
of classical nucleation theory, in particular focusing on the important case of nucleation via metastable intermediates.

Previously, I worked in <a href="http://gold.cchem.berkeley.edu/The_Chandler_Group/Home.html">David Chandler's</a>
research group at <a href="http://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> where I studied the microscopic origins of dynamic
heterogeneity in <a href="research/glass/">supercooled liquids</a>. My work helped to uncover the existence of a novel
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5919/1309"> dynamical phase transition</a> and the presence of localized
<a href="http://prx.aps.org/abstract/PRX/v1/i2/e021013">excitations</a> in atomistic model glass formers.

As well as the scientific software that I write for my day-to-day research, I also enjoy writing handy command-line utilities,
tinkering with my Linux installation, and developing/learning the tools needed to help optimize my workflow. I've released a
few small programs that use Monte Carlo algorithms to create digital artwork, as well as a handy tool for the production of
PDF/PostScript format LaTeX equations for use in figures and presentations. I've also written about my experiences of using
<a href="miscellanea/unix/">unix</a> for scientific research.
