<h2 class="top">Structural order parameters (the easy way)</h2>

<p>
A simple means of computing local structural order in a two-dimensional
atomistic system is by use of bond order parameters such as
</p>

$$\psi_l^j=\frac{1}{n_j}\sum_k \mathrm{exp}\left(i\ell\theta_{jk}\right),$$

<p>
where \(n_j\) is the number of neighbours within the first atom shell of particle \(j\)
and \(\theta_{jk}\) is the angle between the vector connecting particles \(j\) and \(k\)
and the horizontal axis. The parameter \(\ell\) specifies the type of symmetry in
which we are interested, e.g. \(\ell=6\) for six-fold symmetry (hexatic order), as
illustrated in the image below (particles colored yellow have a high degree of hexatic order).

<p>
Computing such an order parameter typically requires calculation of the angles
between all of the nearest neighbour particle pairs. One must first take an
arctangent (or similar) to compute the angle and then use sines and cosines
to evaluate the exponential factor. Such a procedure is rather computationally
expensive, particularly when a large number of statistics are required and one
must consider all particles in the system at multiple time steps. However, there
is a useful trick that lets us evaluate the expression without having to compute
a single pesky sine or cosine.
</p>

<p>
Let us start with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula">Euler's formula</a>
</p>

$$e^{i(x)}=\mathrm{cos}\left(x\right) + i \mathrm{sin}\left(x\right).$$

<p>
Combining with the exponential law for integer powers leads us to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre's_formula">de Moivre's formula</a>
</p>

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(e^{ix}\right)^n&=&e^{inx}\\
e^{i(nx)}&=&\mathrm{cos}\left(nx\right) + i \mathrm{sin}\left(nx\right)\\
\mathrm{cos}\left(nx\right) + i \mathrm{sin}\left(nx\right)&=&\left[\mathrm{cos}(x) + i\mathrm{sin}(x)\right]^n.  \end{eqnarray*}

<p>
This is nothing more than a binomial expansion. Letting \(x=\theta_{jk}\)
and considering a hexatic order parameter gives
</p>

$$e^{i6x}\equiv\mathrm{cos}\left(6x\right) + i \mathrm{sin}\left(6x\right)\equiv\left[\mathrm{cos}(x) + i\mathrm{sin}(x)\right]^6.$$

<p>
The coefficients for a power six binomial expansion are as follows,
</p>

$$1,\ 6,\ 15,\ 20,\ 15,\ 6,\ 1.$$

<p>
If we let \(c=\mathrm{cos}\left(x\right)\) and \(s=\mathrm{sin}\left(x\right)\)
then evaluating the real and imaginary components gives
</p>

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Re \left\{e^{i6x}\right\} &=& c^6 - 15c^4s^2 + 15c^2s^4 - s^6\\
\Im \left\{e^{i6x}\right\} &=& 6c^5s - 20c^3s^3 + 6cs^5
\end{eqnarray*}

<p>
In any molecular dynamics integrator one must compute particle separations in
order to evaluate forces due to the pair potential. For example, in two
dimensions one would measure the magnitude of the separation vector \(\mathbf{r}\)
as well as the \(x\) and \(y\) components, \(\Delta x\) and \(\Delta y\) respectively.
These values can be used to compute the sine and cosine of the angle between the pair
vector and horizontal which in turn can be used in the above expressions to compute
the desired structural order parameter, i.e.
</p>

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{cos}\left(\theta_{jk}\right)&=&\Delta x_{jk}/|\mathbf{r}_{jk}|\\
\mathrm{sin}\left(\theta_{jk}\right)&=&\Delta y_{jk}/|\mathbf{r}_{jk}|
\end{eqnarray*}

<p>
This method allows structural order parameters to be computed on-the-fly within
any molecular dynamics integrator with little additional computational burden.
